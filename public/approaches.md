# Approaches

<v-click>

Any ideas?

<v-click>
  
- increasing block size
- nesting blockchains
- increase consensus efficiency
- state channels
- sidechains
- bundeling / rollups
- parallelization / sharding
  
</v-click>

<!-- 
# nesting vs. sidechains
# state channels
  - no open participation
  - lock up in multi-sig contract
   application specific
# sidenchains
  - rollups utilize sidechains

# Layer-1

- main DLT network protocol itself
- scaling solutions are changes to code or network structure itself
- e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche,...

::right::
# Layer-2

- protocols sitting on top of the L1 to increase scalability or add functionality
- it comes down to **offloading effort off the chain**
- e.g. Optimism, Boba, Loopring..

<!-- 
# L2
  - lower fees
  - maintain security; benefit from mainnet security
  - expand use cases
 -->
