# Motivation

<br/>

- only adjacent edges of one side can be fulfilled
- solving the trilemma could lead to new levels of adoption
- multiple approaches to solve it or at least improve the current state

<!-- 
# Traditional Blockchains
- rely on  every participant running a full node
- verification of transactions on all nodes
- decentralized & secure but **not** really scalable
- Bitcoin, Litecoin, pre-sharding Eth

# High-TPS chains
- small node number
- user have to trust those nodes
- scalable & secure

# Multi-Chain ecosystem
- different applications on different chains
- communication between chains
- attacker could break consensus in one chain and damage other chains
